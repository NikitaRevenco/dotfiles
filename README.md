### Overview

![preview image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb71f763-1449-4232-8521-da587793c09a)

- Tiling Window Manager -> [GlazeWM](https://github.com/glzr-io/glazewm)
- Neovim
- Wezterm
- [Clink](https://github.com/chrisant996/clink) -> Turns cmd.exe into a powerhouse of a shell. All the features of powershell and the speed of zsh
- A _Lot_ of CLI tools (grep, sd, yazi, fzf, zoxide, and dozens of others)

These dotfiles are unlike most others, as you can see I prefer to use 1 config file per app (see `neovim.lua`, `wezterm.lua`, etc.) as opposed to "organizing" them into folders with subdirectories and dozens of smaller files like I'd do with a project

This is possible because all of the apps allow custom configuration path to be passed. I prefer having my configs in `~/dotfiles` (aka `%USERPROFILE%\dotfiles`) as opposed to `.config`. I think it's awesome having everything I need in one place

### Common commands I use

- `t` and `ti`: zoxide which is a superior alternative to the `cd` command

![ti command being used](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01eb38e4-b14e-4dd3-ac28-098f4da11165)

- `e`: Eza which is like `ls` but with icons and color

![e command being used](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5d79c60-b839-4395-ac5c-3df3fb03092e)

- `w`: spawns a wezterm window with working directory same as current
- `n`: open `nvim`
- `r`: sends all of its arguments to the trash
- `i`: runs a one-off command in a folder without `cd`ing into it

You can find most others in the [`doskeys.cmd`](https://github.com/nikitarevenco/dotfiles/blob/main/doskeys.cmd) file (doskeys are like `alias` in bash). For more complicated commands, they can be found in the `scripts/` folder (e.g. the `t` command which is in `t.lua` as we have to use clink to integrate zoxide with cmd.exe since zoxide does not provide official support).

Scripts starting with `_` do not correspond to any command in particular but rather change behaviour of the terminal (e.g. highlight environmental variables)

### Quick Setup

<details>
<summary>
  Linux
</summary>

---

This single command will generate Git SSH keys and copy them into clipboard so I can easily setup Git and GitHub on a new computer in just 2 seconds

```
mkdir -p "$HOME/.ssh" && ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f "$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519" -N "" && cat "$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub"
```

---

Now just clone this repo into `~/dotfiles` (it needs to be there since all the env variables in `wezterm.lua` point to that place) and launch wezterm

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikitarevenco/dotfiles %USERPROFILE%\dotfiles
```
---

Create symlinks:

```
mkdir -p ~/.config/bspwm ~/.config/sxhkd && ln -s ~/dotfiles/bspwm.sh ~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc && ln -s ~/dotfiles/sxhkd.sh ~/.config/sxhkd/sxhkdrc && ln -s ~/dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
```

Windows
</summary>

Windows comes in with hundreds of packages I don't use and that slow down my computer. That's why I use the script below ([win11debloat](https://github.com/Raphire/Win11Debloat)) which removes all those apps and if I ever need them back I can easily reinstall through the Microsoft Store

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm "https://win11debloat.raphi.re/")))
```

---

In my `wezterm.lua` I set the env variables for all other apps, but the below command is required so that that config file can be loaded in the first place. It permanently sets the environment variable in the system

```powershell
setx WEZTERM_CONFIG_FILE "%USERPROFILE%\dotfiles\wezterm.lua"
```

---

This single command will generate Git SSH keys and copy them into clipboard so I can easily setup Git and GitHub on a new computer in just 2 seconds

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh -Force; ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519" -N '""' ; type "$env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub" | clip
```

---

Now just clone this repo into `~/dotfiles` (it needs to be there since all the env variables in `wezterm.lua` point to that place) and launch wezterm

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/nikitarevenco/dotfiles %USERPROFILE%\dotfiles
```
