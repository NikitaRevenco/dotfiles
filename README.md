# Nikita's dotfiles

For the best experience and security I recommend using `Arch`. I wrote
[extremely detailed instructions](https://github.com/nikitarevenco/dotfiles/blob/main/.install/archlinuxinstall.md) on setting up a secure `Arch` environment.

## Installation

- Automatic **backups** are created if there are name conficts.

### pacman package manager

Arch and [all of these distros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Pacman-based_Linux_distributions) can install with a single command.

```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikitarevenco/dotfiles/main/.install/install | bash
```
